I know what you're thinking "Oh great another C# engine", yeah you're right, however, I'm writing this engine for my own education and the education of others by posting notes and commenting my code for others to read. This is going to be a from scratch salt-of-the-earth kind of engine. Come and join me on this adventure together! Make an issue for features you want to see developed, I'll try my best.

Built on top of [Monogame 3.2](http://www.monogame.net/downloads/ "Monogame 2.3")
